There is much, much more. A good starting point is, obviously, the [Get Started](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/get-started.html) page of the OPA documentation.

Also, there's an open Slack workspace where you can get your questions answered or get involved with the community:
[openpolicyagent.slack.com](https://openpolicyagent.slack.com/).

If you want to see an example of how to use OPA in an application, have a look at [az82/micronaut-opa-demo](https://github.com/az82/micronaut-opa-demo).
